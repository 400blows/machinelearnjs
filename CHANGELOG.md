:baby_chick: hooray! initial release :baby_chick:

In the first release of Kalimdorjs, 
it aims to deliver the essential models and algorithms required to conduct 
the fundamental Machine Learning experiment and development. Some APIs still
might be unstable but they will be improved over time as we receive feedback 
from people. You will be seeing new patches being delivered constantly to make gradual
improvements until the library reaches a certain level of maturity.
